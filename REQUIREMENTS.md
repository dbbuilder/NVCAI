# NVC AI Facilitator Application - Requirements

## Project Overview
An AI-powered web application that facilitates Non-Violent Communication (NVC) practice through guided conversations, helping users work through conflicts and develop empathic communication skills using the four-step NVC process.

## Functional Requirements

### Core NVC Facilitation
1. **Four-Step NVC Process**
   - Observations: Guide users to separate facts from interpretations
   - Feelings: Help identify and articulate emotions accurately
   - Needs: Connect feelings to underlying universal human needs
   - Requests: Formulate specific, doable, positive requests

2. **AI Facilitation Capabilities**
   - Act as experienced NVC mediator/facilitator
   - Provide empathic presence and deep listening
   - Guide self-discovery rather than giving direct advice
   - Translate judgments into needs-based language
   - Manage conversation pacing and emotional intensity

3. **Session Management**
   - Individual practice sessions for personal conflicts
   - Progress tracking through NVC steps
   - Session persistence across multiple interactions
   - Historical session review and learning

4. **Educational Components**
   - Feelings vocabulary expansion
   - Universal needs taxonomy
   - NVC examples and practice scenarios
   - Progress tracking and skill development

### Technical Requirements

#### Backend (Python FastAPI)
1. **API Architecture**
   - RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
   - WebSocket support for real-time conversations
   - Async/await patterns for AI model calls
   - Rate limiting and request validation

2. **LangChain Integration**
   - Multi-model support (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude)
   - Conversation memory and context management
   - Prompt engineering for NVC facilitation
   - Chain orchestration for complex workflows

3. **Database Layer**
   - PostgreSQL with stored procedures
   - Encrypted data storage for conversations
   - Audit logging for HIPAA compliance
   - Session state persistence

#### Frontend (Vue.js + TypeScript)
1. **User Interface**
   - Conversational chat interface
   - NVC progress visualization
   - Interactive feelings and needs selectors
   - Calming, minimalist design with Tailwind CSS

2. **Real-time Features**
   - WebSocket chat connection
   - Live AI responses
   - Typing indicators
   - Session state synchronization

3. **Type Safety**
   - TypeScript interfaces for all API calls
   - NVC-specific type definitions
   - Generated API client from OpenAPI spec

#### Security & Compliance
1. **HIPAA Compliance**
   - Data encryption at rest and in transit
   - Audit logging for all access
   - User consent and privacy controls
   - Secure session management

2. **Authentication**
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - Session timeout and refresh
   - Role-based access control
   - Multi-factor authentication support

#### Deployment (AWS)
1. **Infrastructure**
   - ECS Fargate for containerized backend
   - CloudFront + S3 for frontend hosting
   - RDS PostgreSQL with encryption
   - Application Load Balancer with SSL

2. **Monitoring**
   - CloudWatch application monitoring
   - Distributed tracing with X-Ray
   - Error logging and alerting
   - Performance metrics

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Response time < 2 seconds for AI interactions
- Support 100+ concurrent users
- 99.9% uptime availability
- Scalable architecture for growth

### Security
- SOC 2 compliance preparation
- Penetration testing ready
- Data retention policies
- Secure API key management

### Usability
- Intuitive conversational interface
- Accessible design (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Progressive web app capabilities

### Reliability
- Graceful error handling
- AI model fallback mechanisms
- Data backup and recovery
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Success Metrics
- User engagement: session completion rate > 80%
- AI quality: user satisfaction rating > 4.0/5.0
- Performance: 95th percentile response time < 3 seconds
- Reliability: system uptime > 99.9%

## Constraints
- HIPAA compliance required for production
- Multi-AI model support for vendor independence
- PostgreSQL stored procedures for data operations
- TypeScript for frontend type safety
- Calming, minimalist UI design principles
